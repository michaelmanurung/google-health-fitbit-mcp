# Security Policy

Report security issues through GitHub issues if they do not contain secrets, or email klcogluberk@gmail.com for anything sensitive. Do not paste OAuth tokens, client secrets, raw GPS exports or private activity payloads.

## Sensitive Data

- Google Health client secret
- OAuth access and refresh tokens
- Raw activity streams
- GPS coordinates, route maps and polylines
- Private activity metadata

## Defaults

- Local config is written with `0600` permissions where supported.
- The server is read-only by default.
- GPS/map data is redacted unless explicitly requested.
